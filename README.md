### Hello World !! Welcome to my github 👋

Currently, I am a student at the IUT (University Institute of Technology) in Montpellier-Sète, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am also working in an apprenticeship at Actiatelecom as a Designer Developer, where my responsibilities involve the low-level network layer of the software. Specifically, I focus on securing the software's network layer using existing or custom protocols, which handle various types of transmissions and receptions such as video and/or audio streaming, file metadata, texts, and more. My mission entails securing all these aspects, which has required me to delve deeply into file architectures.

Outside the professional sphere, I am an enthusiast of low-level development and building things from scratch. I enjoy comprehending the functioning of each layer. My dream is to create a machine entirely from scratch, from designing the CPU to programming software on it, encompassing the creation of the OS, network card drivers, file systems, and much more. During my free time, I engage in self-taught learning through platforms like Udemy or Coursera. I also undertake personal projects, as you can see below, which often revolve around network development, system development, cryptography, and embedded system development.
